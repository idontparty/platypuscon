### Introduction
The git repo that contains everything surrounding the platypuscon badges
(2016). Hope you enjoyed the con! Tweet/msg me @
[idont](https://twitter.com/idont_party) if you have questions or feedback.


### Parts list
- PCB (or make your own with cardboard (kudos - please hit me up if you're that
  guy!!!))
- Arduino programmer
- AVR ATtiny85 (dip8 package)
- 220 Ohm through-hole resistors x6
- RED led x3
- GREEN led x2
- YELLOW led x1
- smd CR2032 battery mount (the slide-in type)
- CR2032 battery


And obviously soldering stuff (at the minium a soldering iron and some solder).
Picture of an assembled badge will be published soon (I hope I remember to
update the readme).


### How2
This section will be filled in later - in desparate need of sleep and other
useful stuff.
- program the AVR attiny85 with an arduino
- dump the memory of the AVR ATtiny85 with an arduino (and get the flag -
  profit)
- how2solder
- how2placeComponents
And probably heaps more? This is very optimistic
